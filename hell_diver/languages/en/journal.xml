		<text value="First, take a look at the map (%control_map) to gain an idea where you are right now. You should observe where your nearest friendly base is and which areas the enemies hold.%PSFind friendlies, and join the attack once the commander calls it. It's wise to stay with others and support them when you're starting as you don't yet have a squad of your own. Try not to lead the battle.%PSUse chat log (%control_statistics) to re-check what the commander has said on the radio." />

	<entry key="first_death_at_start">
		<title value="Cover system" />
		<text value="The most important part of staying alive is using various obstacles for cover. You can use crouch (%control_crouch) and prone (%control_prone) to make yourself smaller and harder to hit. When crouching behind an obstacle of suitable size, you'll automatically stand to fire over it when firing (%control_shoot)." />

		<title value="Equipment supply on respawn" />
		<text value="When you die, all your equipment and items in your backpack are dropped on ground. The items will stay there for a limited time until they disappear, with rarer items lasting longer.%PSWhen spawning after death, most of your equipment will be reacquired with the RP cost automatically, with exceptions on items marked as non-auto-supplied, such as armored vests or rare weapons.%PSUsing non-auto-supplied items will require you to pay extra attention to staying alive, so prepare accordingly." />

	<entry key="low_encumbrance_exceeded">
		<title value="Backpack and encumbrance" />
		<text value="Backpack works as a temporary storage for items, usually for carrying items back to a Stash or Armory. When you die, all backpack items are dropped on ground.%PSEach item has an encumbrance value. When you have over 20% encumbrance, encumbrance penalties begin to kick in: movement speed and shooting accuracy both suffer gradual penalties.%PSWhen encumbrance reaches 60%, the large backpack visual appears on your character and your fighting capability will be seriously hindered. Consider dropping some items before engaging in battle." />

		<image filename="journal_base.png" />
		<text value="Bases are captured by a faction having more troops (twice as many) in the base center area than the enemy.%PSOnce a base is captured, the enemy may re-capture it with a counterattack, so it's a good idea to ensure there are some defending troops before moving on."/>

		<text value="The Armory provides your faction's basic weapons and items for your disposal.%PSWhen you find loot, bring it to armory to gain RP (resource points).%PSBringing in 5 common enemy weapons (not rare weapons) will unlock that weapon in the Armory and make it available for your faction as well. Delivering a briefcase or laptop to an armory unlocks new higher tier weapons.%PSIf you manage to capture an enemy cargo truck, bring it to an Armory for rewards." />

		<image filename="journal_stash.png" />
		<text value="The Stash is your personal permanent storage. Use it to hold items you don't want to lose or can't use yet.%PSIt's smart to bring rare weapons out of your experience level to the Stash, saving them until you've ranked up enough to use them.%PSNote that all Stashes are connected, so you can fill it up with various goodies and access those items anywhere on the map, including in enemy territory." />

	<entry key="inspect/vehicle/any">
	    <title value="Vehicles" />
		<text value="Vehicles provide ways for faster travel. Some of them are armed, while others may have an Armory inventory, or they may function as mobile spawn points.%PSVarious seats, such as the driver, gunner, and passenger can be accessed from different sides of the vehicle. Approach a seat and press jump (%control_jump) to enter. If the prompt is available and an enemy is occupying the seat, he will be pulled out. This also works for commandeering a vehicle from lower ranking friendly soldiers.%PSNote that some vehicles can only be effectively used together with a squad, such as Tanks." />

	<entry key="inspect/apc/friendly">
	    <title value="APCs" />
		<text value="The APC has a single gunner seat in addition to a driver seat, and several passenger seats in the back. You'll need at least one squadmate to operate the APC effectively.

	<entry key="inspect/tank/friendly">
	    <title value="Tanks" />
		<text value="The Tank has two gunner seats in addition to a driver seat. You'll need at least one squadmate to operate a tank effectively, preferably two.

	<entry key="inspect/armored_truck.vehicle/friendly">
	    <title value="Spawn trucks" />
		<text value="The Spawn truck is a vehicle only players can use. When not moving, and not too close to the enemy, it allows you to respawn next to it. This makes it highly valuable for conducting flanking attacks and when fighting in areas lacking nearby spawnpoints.%PSThe Spawn truck also works great as a checkpoint when traveling behind enemy lines.%PSPlenty of passengers can also fit in the truck." />
		<image filename="journal_spawntruck.png" />
	</entry>

	<entry key="inspect/mobile_armory.vehicle/any">
	    <title value="Armory trucks" />
		<text value="The Armory truck is a mobile Armory which only players can control. It functions identically to a regular Armory. A few friendly soldiers will loiter near to defend it when it's not moving.%PSIt's often a good idea to take it close to the front line to shorten the running distance to the nearest Armory." />

	<entry key="xp_achieved/150"> <!-- was 100 -->
		<title value="Grenades" />
		<text value="Grenades are great for clearing cover and eliminating tight groups of enemies with a blast. Use %control_grenade to throw the grenade towards the crosshair position. You'll need to experiment with it to get a feel how far you can throw them, and it varies a bit between different types of grenades and height difference between you and the target.%PSGrenades also make an easy way to get combo kills for extra XP rewards." />

	<entry key="xp_achieved/50"> <!-- was 200 -->
		<title value="Assault rifles" />
		<text value="Assault rifles are generally the most balanced weapons between range and power. Try firing in short bursts to keep the spread tight. Shooting from crouch or prone gives a large accuracy boost compared to standing or shooting while moving. Keep an eye on the reticule, which indicates spread, and how it is impacted by the weapon's recoil." />
		<image filename="journal_ar.png" />

	<entry key="xp_achieved/250">
		<title value="Deployables" />
		<text value="Sandbag deployables let you create static cover that can withstand any amount of small-arms fire, and even a few blasts from grenades. Swap to the secondary weapon slot (%control_swap_weapon), hold %control_shoot and aim to set the direction.%PSNew deployable items can be unlocked by completing cargo truck missions and delivering briefcases." />

		<title value="Riot shields" />
		<text value="Riot shields can be used to block bullets. First, swap to the secondary slot (%control_swap_weapon), then point the reticule in the direction you intend to shield and hold %control_shoot. Other soldiers can use the shield as a wall to shoot over. %PSHand grenade blasts damage the shield and will stun the user, and impact nades are even deadlier.%PSShields can be especially useful in open areas lacking cover." />

		<title value="Shotguns" />
		<text value="Shotguns have great power in short range, but are useless against enemies farther away. Consequentially, they excell in close-quarters battle, such as urban areas and trenches. Stance makes little effect on accuracy, and so can be fired fairly well even while moving." />
		<image filename="journal_shotguns.png" />
	</entry>

	<entry key="inspect/medikit.weapon">
		<title value="Medikit" />
		<text value="The Medikit can be used to heal a wounded soldier laying on the ground. Move close to the wounded soldier, swap to secondary weapon (%control_swap_weapon) and hold (%control_shoot) until they stand up again.%PSOnly soldiers who are wearing a vest have a chance to become wounded, and you can't use the medikit on yourself.%PSMedikit is a particularly useful tool in multiplayer!" />

	<entry key="xp_achieved/500">
		<title value="Machine guns" />
		<text value="Machine guns have a large spread, long range, and good damage - but require shooting from prone or over a wall, making them less versatile than other weapons. Use them in sieges or for fighting against large groups of enemies." />
		<image filename="journal_mg.png" />
	</entry>

	<entry key="xp_achieved/500">
		<title value="Rocket-Launchers" />
		<text value="Rocket-Launchers are the foot soldiers' primary defense against vehicles. After purchasing one, swap to the secondary weapon slot(%control_swap_weapon), aim carefully - watching the reticule and spread - and shoot the target with %control_shoot when ready.%PSNote that Rocket-Launchers cannot be reloaded, they're one-time use only." />

		<title value="Anti-air emplacements" />
		<image filename="journal_aa.png" />
		<text value="Some maps feature an enemy anti-air emplacement that prevent friendly airdrop radio calls, e.g. paratroopers. Find the emplacement in enemy territory and destroy it to enable the calls again. Stealth and C4 will suit nicely for the job, but there are other ways about it.%PSAA emplacements will not respawn once destroyed." />
	</entry>

	<entry key="spawn/radar_tower.vehicle/enemy">
		<title value="Radar towers and comms" />
		<image filename="journal_radar_tower.png" />
		<text value="A radar tower manages faction's comms between commander and troops. Destroying an enemy radar tower numbs them down, meaning the enemy 1) ceases to attack, 2) has reduced soldier spawning rate and capacity, and 3) cannot move troops between bases until the tower respawns.%PSDue to its importance the tower is heavily guarded, so you'll likely need to use stealth to get to it. Don't forget the C4!%PSThe tower also jams radio calls in the surrounding area." />

		<text value="A radar truck manages a faction's comms between commander and troops. Destroying a radar truck numbs them down, meaning the enemy 1) ceases to attack, 2) has reduced soldier spawning rate and capacity, and 3) cannot move troops between bases until the truck respawns.%PSRadar trucks have extra guards, and the truck driver attempts to flee to another base when engaged.%PSThe truck also jams radio calls in the surrounding area." />

		<title value="Radio jammers" />
		<image filename="journal_radio_jammer.png" />
		<text value="Enemy Radio jammers prevents making radio calls when you are nearby, effectively providing resistance against mortar strikes and paratroopers. Jammers tend to be guarded by a few soldiers. Sneak in and use C4 or other explosives to destroy them." />

		<title value="Cargo trucks" />
		<image filename="journal_cargo_truck.png" />
		<text value="Enemy cargo trucks can be captured using various methods, and delivering one to a friendly Armory will unlock a new resource.%PSThe driver tends to park the vehicle somewhere in enemy territory, and will flee when in contact. You'll need to be quick and sneaky to get to the driver door to pull him out (%control_jump) and fight him to capture the vehicle.%PSYou can also damage the truck with explosives to disable it (if you don't over-do it!). You'll need to repair it with wrenches to drive it back to Armory."/>

		<title value="Vests" />
		<text value="Wearing a vest allows you to take some hits that would otherwise be lethal. Each hit will deteriorate the vest properties - the first hit will be absorbed by the vest, the second one will stun and the last hit will wound the wearer.%PSWhile wounded, you can call for a medic with %control_shoot, or forcibly respawn by holding down %control_knife.
